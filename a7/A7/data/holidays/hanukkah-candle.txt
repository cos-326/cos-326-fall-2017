Herbie the Hanukkah Candle,
Had a very shiny light,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say its bright.
All of the other candles,
Used to laugh and call him names,
They never let poor Herbie,
Join in any Hanukkah games.

Then one foggy Hanukkah Eve,
The Rabbi came to say, 
"Herbie with your light so bright, 
Won't you be my Shammash tonight"?

Then all of the candles loved him, 
As they shouted out with glee, 
Herbie the Hannukah Candle,
You'll go down in history!
