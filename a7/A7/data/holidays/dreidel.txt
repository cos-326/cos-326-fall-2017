I have a little dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it’s dry and ready
Oh dreidel, I shall play

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of clay
And when you’re dry and ready
Oh Dreidel we shall play

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of wood
And when you are all ready
I’ll play you when I could

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of glass
And when you are all ready
I’ll play you on the grass

Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of gold
And when you are all ready
I’ll play you in the cold
