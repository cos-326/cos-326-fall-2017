(* Testing *)

(* In this file, we build abstract syntax trees representing various
   functions for the purpose of testing our evaluators.

   You will have to construct some additional functions yourself.

(*******************************)
(* QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO ANSWER *)
(*******************************)

(* NOTE: NONE OF THE FUNCTIONS YOU WRITE BELOW SHOULD INCLUDE
 * Closure (env,f,x,e)
 *
 * Define recursive functions using the Rec(f,x,body) form
 *)

(* Replace the constant "one" below with your implementation of 
   the function map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list 
   Note: do not implement this as map: (('a -> 'b)*'a list) -> 'b list
 *)
let map = one
    
(* Replace the constant "one" below with your implementation of 
   the function plus1 that adds one to an integer *)
let plus1 = one

(* Use plus1 and map, defined above, to implement the function 
   incr_all, which adds 1 to every element of a list. Examples:

   incr_all [] == []
   incr_all [1;2;3] == [2;3;4]
*)
let incr_all = one

(* Replace the constant one below by implementing a function that 
 * takes a list of pairs of integers and returns a list of integers 
 * where each element of the list is the sum of the elements of the 
 * pairs.  Examples:

  sum_pairs [] == []
  sum_pairs [(1,2); (3,4)] == [3; 7]
 *)

let sum_pairs = one
