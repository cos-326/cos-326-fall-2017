Part 2, Assignment #4, COS 326
------------------------------



Part 2.1:
--------

Prove that for all a, b, c : complex,

cadd a (cadd b c) == cadd (cadd a b) c

Proof:







Part 2.2: 
---------

Prove that for all integer lists xs and ys,
max (maxs xs) (maxs ys) == (maxs (append xs ys)).

Clearly justify each step of your proof.

Proof:  By induction on the structure of the list xs.

case xs == []:

To show:

Proof:






case xs == hd::tail:

IH:   

To show:   

Proof:



QED!

Part 2.3: 
---------

(a) Prove that for all integer lists l, bump1 l == bump2 l.

Proof: 







(b) Prove that for all integer lists l, bump1 l == bump3 l.

Proof:








(c) In one sentence, what's the big difference between parts (a) and (b)?





Part 2.4:
---------

Either prove or disprove each of the following. You will do any proofs using
induction on lists and you will disprove any false statement by providing a
counter-example to the claim.  When you do a proof, be sure to use the 
standard template for list proofs.

(a) For all l : ('a * 'b) list, zip(unzip l) == l.







(b) For all l1 : 'a list, l2 : 'b list, unzip(zip (l1,l2)) == (l1,l2).
